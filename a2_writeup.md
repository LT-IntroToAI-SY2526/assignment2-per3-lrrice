# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

I found it hard sometimes to keep track of all the variables and functions. Especialy in check #2, which was much more complicated. The part with a if statement in a while loop in an else statement in another if statement in an elif statement kind of hurt my brain.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

The match function could be used to sift through many different possible queries from a user and figure out what information it needs to find for what movie by being able to recognize and ignore certain words and syntaxes. It allows for the user to type freely and recieve consistent responses from the chatbot.
